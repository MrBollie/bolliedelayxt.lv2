The evolution of my bolliedelay.lv2

![screenshot](https://github.com/MrBollie/bolliedelayxt.lv2/blob/tablelfo/modgui/screenshot-bolliedelayxt.png)

It now features 
- full control over two seperate channels
- HPF/LPF on both, the delay path and feedback path
- fractional delay, that enables modulation

This plugin can also be used outside the MOD world, by simply running:
- make
- make install

Have fun and input is always welcome! :D
